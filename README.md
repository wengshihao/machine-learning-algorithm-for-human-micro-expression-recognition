# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-for-Human-Micro-Expression-Recognition
Code of My Undergraduate Thesis in [School of AI&CS, JNU](http://ai.jiangnan.edu.cn/) supervised by [Heng-Yang Lu](http://iip.nju.edu.cn/index.php/Luhy)
## 1. Four dilemmas in micro-expression recognition
**No.1** Face diversity dilemma, specifically refers to the human face of different individuals, facial differences and different posture of the problem.

**No.2** Behavioral spontaneity dilemma, specifically refers to the micro-expression of human uncontrolled spontaneous behavior, resulting in the amplitude
Small enough to be difficult to detect.

**No.3** Transient dilemma, it refers to the problem of short duration of micro-expression (0.04s ~ 0.3s).

**No.4** "Human-machine collaboration" dilemma, specifically refers to the high time cost and low efficiency of manually rechecking each micro-expression recognized by the computer.

## 2. The solution to the face diversity dilemma
