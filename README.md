# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-for-Human-Micro-Expression-Recognition
Code of My Undergraduate Thesis in [School of AI&CS, JNU](http://ai.jiangnan.edu.cn/) supervised by [Heng-Yang Lu](http://iip.nju.edu.cn/index.php/Luhy)
## 1. Three dilemmas in microexpression recognition
(1) Face diversity dilemma, specifically refers to the human face of different individuals, facial differences and different posture of the problem.

(2) Behavioral spontaneity dilemma, specifically refers to the micro-expression of human uncontrolled spontaneous behavior, resulting in the amplitude
Small enough to be difficult to detect.

(3) Transient dilemma, it refers to the problem of short duration of micro-expression (0.04s ~ 0.3s).

(4) "Human-machine collaboration" dilemma, specifically refers to the high time cost and low efficiency of manually rechecking each micro-expression recognized by the computer.

## 2. The solution to the face diversity dilemma
